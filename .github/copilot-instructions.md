# Project-Specific Instructions for AI Assistants

This is an academic CS 3120 project. All code, documentation, and outputs must follow academic standards.

## Language Guidelines

### Prohibited Language Patterns

Never use:
- First-person plural (we, we'll, we're, let's, let us)
  - WRONG: "Let's implement this feature"
  - CORRECT: "This implements the feature" OR "I will implement this feature"

- Marketing/enthusiastic language
  - WRONG: "Breaking free from constraints"
  - WRONG: "State-of-the-art"
  - WRONG: "Production-ready"
  - WRONG: "Amazing", "awesome", "exciting"
  - WRONG: Excessive exclamation marks
  - CORRECT: Use neutral, professional terminology

- Emojis (never use in code, documentation, or comments)

### Required Language Patterns

Always use:
- First-person singular when referring to the developer
  - CORRECT: "I implemented this feature"
  - CORRECT: "This project demonstrates..."

- Neutral, academic tone
  - CORRECT: "This system provides..."
  - CORRECT: "The implementation includes..."
  - CORRECT: "Results demonstrate..."

- Professional descriptions
  - Instead of "production-ready" use "functional" or "complete"
  - Instead of "state-of-the-art" use "modern" or "current"
  - Instead of "amazing results!" use "notable results."

## Code Standards

- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Write comments only when logic is not self-evident
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Focus on academic clarity over production optimization

## Documentation Standards

- Documentation should be technical and informative
- Use present tense for describing capabilities
- Avoid superlatives and promotional language
- Citations should use standard academic format

## Examples

### INCORRECT
```markdown
# Amazing Music Classifier

We're going to build a state-of-the-art production-ready system that will blow your mind!
Let's get started with this exciting project!
```

### CORRECT
```markdown
# Music Genre Classification System

This project implements a music genre classification system using convolutional neural networks.
The implementation includes feature extraction, model training, and evaluation components.
```

Remember: This is a single-developer academic project. All language should reflect that context.
